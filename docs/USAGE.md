# Using MLAppInstaller

## Installing components

`mlai install` reads a TOML manifest and installs every component marked
`default = true` (or a single named component via `--component`).

```bash
mlai install --manifest manifest.toml --install-root ~/my-app
```

## Manifest format

```toml
manifest_version = "1.0.0"

[[components]]
name = "hello-component"
source_url = "https://example.com/hello-component.zip"
ref = "main"
default = true

[components.setup]
command = "setup.sh"
args = []

[components.health]
type = "file_exists"
path = "marker.txt"
```

- `source_url` — a direct HTTPS URL to a zip archive. The archive's single
  top-level folder is renamed to the component's `name` after extraction.
- `ref` — recorded as the installed version; used to detect whether a
  re-run needs to reinstall.
- `setup` — optional command run inside the unpacked component directory
  after unpack.
- `health` — optional check run after setup; today supports `file_exists`.
  A component with no `health` block is always considered healthy once
  setup succeeds.

## Install state

State is written to `<install-root>/.mlai-install/installed.json` after
every pipeline stage (`downloaded`, `unpacked`, `setup_run`, `healthy`, or
`needs_attention`), so a crashed install resumes rather than restarts.
Re-running `mlai install` against a component already `healthy` at the
manifest's `ref` is a no-op.

## Backups

Before a component directory is replaced, its previous contents are copied
to `<install-root>/.mlai-install/backups/<ref>/<component-name>`. The
newest 3 backups are kept; older ones are pruned automatically.

## Private sources

Set `MLAI_TOKEN` in the environment to send a bearer token with the
component download request (for private/authenticated source URLs).

## Not yet implemented

`repair`, `uninstall`, `update`, local-vs-hosted backend selection, and
cloud config generation are planned follow-ups — see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-foundation-design.md`.
